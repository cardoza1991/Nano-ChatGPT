It is not recommended to put all of the text data into a single Python file as this can make the file large and difficult to manage. 
Instead, it is more common to store the text data in a separate file or files and then load the data into your Python script as needed.

There are several file formats that can be used to store text data, including plain text files, CSV files, and JSON files. 
The choice of file format will depend on the structure of your data and how you plan to use it in your model.

For example, if you have a large amount of text data that is not structured, a plain text file might be the most appropriate format. 
If your data is structured and contains multiple columns or fields, a CSV file might be a better choice. 
If you want to store more complex data structures such as dictionaries or nested lists, a JSON file might be the best option.

Once you have stored your text data in a file or files, you can use Python's built-in file handling functions to read the data into your script. 
For example, you can use the open() function to open a file, and then use the read() function to read the contents of the file into a string variable.

Here is an example of how to read text data from a plain text file:
# Open the file for reading
with open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
    # Read the contents of the file into a string variable
    text_data = f.read()

# Print the text data
print(text_data)


In this example, data.txt is the name of the file that contains the text data. 
The with statement is used to open the file and ensure that it is closed properly when the block of code is finished. 
The read() function is used to read the contents of the file into the text_data variable, which can then be used in your model.
